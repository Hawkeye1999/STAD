I am of the opinion that the "STAD" project suits me the most among the projects presented. I have experience of working with computer vision which I gained from a computer vision course when I was an exchange student in Italy. During my summer internship this summer at Volvo CE I also worked a lot with computer vision for people detection/tracking for multiple cameras.Â 

In addition I have good knowledge in AI. I have even been doing extra courses within this topic where I have worked with CNNs for example which I believe is relevant for this project.

I also feel comfortable working with mobile robotics related topics, for example behavioral robotics, localization and path planning.

As previously mentioned I worked at Volvo CE during the summer which I enjoyed a lot. I would really like to collaborate with them more and therefore I also think it might be beneficial for me to be in this project since I already have contacts at Volvo CE related to this project.


I believe I am highly qualified for the Software team leader role since I have a lot of experience of leadership and project management which I have gained from different associations. I have for example worked with a project where I have been negotiating with different companies to get funding and resources for the project. This particular experience could actually also be a benificial experience for the "STAD" project since there are many companies involved within this project. I also have experience being the president of an association and therefore have a lot of experience being responsible for meetings and collaborating with people.

I am also proficient in planning, usually have many innovative ideas and therefore think that I can help the project heading towards the optimal direction.

As previously mentioned I have good knowledge within the software related topics to this project. I feel comfortable using several programming languages. I have most experience using C, Python, and Matlab.
